# sbcs-careers-in-code-2.0

# Feedback on the current course.
- Classes are taught at the pace of the slowest participant.
- The code-pen and SQL bolt are generally stuff they can follow.
- The Node and VSCode are to difficult and time consuing to setup and get working for some students.

# Suggested Change to the Course Flow
- Create a cohesive theme for all 4 courses around Movies and Film.
- Ensure that the content and discussion for each week are glued together well.
- Develop an Infographic that shows the types of careers, Job Titles, and how they relate to the skills students have been introduced to.  Finally, provide where to go next / how to learn more for each career.

## Proposed Weekly Structure
1. CSS + HTML (Code pen working)
2. JAVASCRIPT / SQL Lite (potentially move to some type of locally hosted javascript sql framework)
3. SIMPLE PROJECT - E.G. Movie Quote Generator
4. Cloud, Networking, and Security
